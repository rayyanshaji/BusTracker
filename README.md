# BusTracker
** Project Name: **   Bus Tracking Application
** Project Members: **   Machila Kalyalya and Mohammed Rayyan Shaji
** Project Abstract: **  Public transport in cities plays a major role in our lives, because it’s cheap and doesn’t require an individual to own a car. We rely on it to get to places and it’s also important that we spend less time waiting for a bus while getting to our desired destination on time. Due to traffic at certain times of the day, such as rush hour, there are times when we get inaccurate arrival times on even official bus tracking applications which might cause us to eventually miss it. Thus, we are proposing a solution in our project which will solve the shortcomings of current bus tracking applications. 
** Features Completed: **  Following our previous update, we made some changes to the features of the application while maintaining the originally established scope. The changes made include:
** Auto-complete Search bar: **  This replaces the drop-down menus which were previously developed. We also made the search of starting and destination addresses dynamic based on landmarks.

** Issues if any: ** 
Save feature: We are in the process of refining the save process from the map to the database. Currently, it is saving null fields as placeholders though we would like the application to save the full particulars from the search fields, so that the search fields are populated with the origin and destination address automatically.
Project Plan (Schedule/Timeline): From our previous update, a number of tasks have been accomplished though we still need to finalize two more components. However, this will not affect our overall timeline.
